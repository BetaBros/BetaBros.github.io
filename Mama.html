<h3>
I'm a pcm student (NO JEE) and a professional typist with over 60k karma on reddit, meaning I have no life. I used to be a national level shooter (medalist) and a state level badminton player but now I'm just fat thicc. I spend 1/3rd of my weekRgHHZ69qzQQ&ab listening to music (according to spotify stats) and spend more than 10 hours a day on Discord. Anyone who said life gets better seems to be wrong insofar.
